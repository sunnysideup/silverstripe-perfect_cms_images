- Images are saved into a unique folder

In more detail, to make it easier to manage image sizes in the various places (CMS, templates) we have set up a system to manage image sizes in just one place (the config layer).  Each unique image collection (e.g. HomePageBanner) has its own standard settings (all optional):
 - `width`
 - `height`
 - `folder for upload`
 - `file type`
 - `enforce_size`

You can also provide a backup image in the SiteConfig in case the user has not (yet) uploaded an image.
