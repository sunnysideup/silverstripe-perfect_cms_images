[CHILDREN Folder=01_Instructions]


# Nota Bene

 * use a unique image name for each image field you add to the site
   e.g. call an image AccountsBanner instead of Banner
 * dont double the image sizes
 * you can choose to only set the standard height or the width



# Important Note for those using Hash Path module


Note that you can use `perfect_cms_images_append_title_to_image_links_classes`
to add titles to images so that you get better SEO results.
For this you will need to strip out the title part from the link using `.htaccess` (see bottom of this info)

If you are using the Hash Path module then a hash path will be added to all links created by the Perfect CMS Images module.  To ensure that your images will be displayed you may need to add the following to your .htaccess file in the Assets folder.

```apacheconfig
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.+)\.(v[A-Za-z0-9]+)\.(js|css|png|PNG|jpg|JPG|gif|GIF)$ $1.$3 [L]
</IfModule>
```
